Q: How do I connect the Vacancy Lab Plugin to Vacancy Lab?
A: Log into your WordPress Admin area and go to Settings > Vacancy Lab. Under the 'Connection Details' heading enter any username and password you would like. Make a note of the 'URL for Vacancy Lab', 'Username' and 'Password'.
Then, when you are logged into Vacancy Lab with Administrator privileges, go to Tools > Options > Web. Under the 'Website Upload/Download' section, select HTTP(S), enter your 'URL for Vacancy Lab' in 'Transfer URL', the 'Username' and the 'Password' you entered above into the following boxes. Finally, save the options.

Q: How do I set the page that the Vacancies will be listed?
A: Log into your WordPress Admin area and go to Settings > Vacancy Lab. Under the 'Vacancies Settings' heading, you can select the page the vacancies should be displayed on and whether you want users to be able to search by text, location or position.

Q: How do I set the page that the Candidate application form will appear on?
A: You can also set the Candidate application form page under the 'Candidate Settings' heading in the same way.

Q: How do I update the website with my latest Vacancies?
A: There are two ways to do this. 
To publish an individual Vacancy, Open the Vacancy, go to Web Publishing > Website and click the 'Publish' button in the bottom right of the screen.
Alternatively, you can publish all vacancies that are marked to be published on the website. These Vacancies need to flagged in the following way: Open a Vacancy, go to Web Publishing > Website - check the 'Publish' checkbox. When you are ready to publish in bulk, go to Tools > Options > Web - and click 'Upload Vacancies Now!'. Any Vacancies already on the site will be updated if there are any changes to them, any that are no longer selected will be removed and any new Vacancies will be added to the website.

Q: How do I download Candidate information from the website?
A: In Vacancy Lab, when you are logged into Vacancy Lab with Administrator privileges, go to Tools > Web Registration(Candidate). When the page opens, you may already see a list of the candidates available from the website. To get the latest list, click the 'Download' button.
You can go through each record by clicking on the line in the table - the data entered will appear on the right. If you would like to add the applicant to your database, just click 'Register & Skill' - this will start the 'Candidate Add wizard' in Vacancy Lab as usual.
